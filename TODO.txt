chatgtp add_task responds too enthusiasticly to "I started X"
	for some reason it thinks that's a new task to add and not updating the status of a task


https://codeconfessions.substack.com/p/navigating-sharp-edges-in-openais
	has some interesting things
	eg: possibly I should be returning a result for chatgtp functions, so chatgtp responds, rather than me putting out a manual reply?


write more tests
?move services to chat_gtp folder
